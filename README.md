# QuantumEncoding
To put all my Grover-Rudolph algorithm code in. Will probably end up being the main repository for all amplitude encoding things
Test
## Using qiskit_tools.py
This program is based off the paper by Hayes, et al.
https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11073
And makes uses of the qiskit_tools.py file which can be found:
